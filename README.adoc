**Pure WebAssembly Text (WAT) static site generator.**

Proving WAT is viable as a source language, not just a compilation target.

== Who Is This For?

* **WebAssembly enthusiasts** exploring WAT's potential
* **Low-level web developers** who think in stack machines
* **WASM toolchain builders** seeking reference implementations
* **Adventurous programmers** who enjoy extreme challenges

== Why wagasm-ssg?

=== WAT as Source

This isn't Rust-compiled-to-WASM or AssemblyScript. The SSG is hand-written in WebAssembly Text format. Every instruction is intentional.

=== S-Expression Clarity

WAT uses Lisp-like S-expressions. If you can read Scheme, you can read WAT.

[source,wat]
----
(func $build_page (param $content i32) (result i32)
  (call $parse_markdown (local.get $content))
  (call $apply_template)
  (call $write_html))
----

=== Educational Depth

Understanding WAT means understanding WebAssembly at its core. No abstractions hiding the machine.

=== Portable by Design

WASM runs everywhere. Your SSG works identically in browsers, Deno, Node, and standalone runtimes.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Compile WAT to WASM
wat2wasm src/wagasm-ssg.wat -o wagasm-ssg.wasm

# Run with Deno host
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts

# Or with wasm-interp
wasm-interp --host-print wagasm-ssg.wasm
----

== Architecture

----
wagasm-ssg.wat    (ALL SSG logic - markdown, templates, routing)
       │
       ▼
   host.ts        (I/O only - read/write files, console)
----

The host provides only file I/O. All content processing happens in WAT.

== Requirements

* WABT (WebAssembly Binary Toolkit) for `wat2wasm`
* Deno, Node, or another WASM runtime

== Part of poly-ssg

wagasm-ssg is part of the https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg[poly-ssg] family, unified through https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg-mcp[MCP integration].
