**EXPERIMENTAL: The pure WebAssembly Text static site generator.**

[WARNING]
====
This is an experimental project demonstrating WAT as a source language.
wagasm-ssg proves that an SSG can be written in pure WebAssembly Text format.
====

== Overview

wagasm-ssg is an extreme experiment: a static site generator written
entirely in WebAssembly Text (WAT) format. No AssemblyScript, no Rust
compiled to WASM - pure hand-written WAT.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in pure WAT. No exceptions.

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** for SSG logic:

* TypeScript (was incorrectly used before as wasm-ssg.ts)
* JavaScript
* AssemblyScript (that's TypeScript in disguise)
* Rust compiled to WASM (defeats the purpose)
* Any high-level language

The host runtime (`runtime/host.ts`) provides **ONLY I/O**:

* `write_file` - Write bytes to a file
* `read_file` - Read bytes from a file
* `log` - Log a message

ALL SSG logic is in the WAT file. The host is a dumb I/O provider.
====

== Why WAT?

* Proves WAT is viable as a source language, not just a compilation target
* S-expression syntax (like Lisp/Scheme) is readable
* Educational value in understanding WASM at the lowest level
* Extreme challenge by design

== Requirements

* WABT (WebAssembly Binary Toolkit) - for `wat2wasm`
* Deno (for the host runtime I/O)

== Building

[source,bash]
----
# Compile WAT to WASM
wat2wasm src/wagasm-ssg.wat -o src/wagasm-ssg.wasm

# Run with Deno host
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts
