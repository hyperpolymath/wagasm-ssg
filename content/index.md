# Welcome to wagasm-ssg

This page was generated by **wagasm-ssg**, a static site generator written entirely in WebAssembly Text (WAT).

## Why WAT?

WAT is the human-readable text format for WebAssembly. While most WASM projects use higher-level languages that compile to WASM, wagasm-ssg proves that WAT can be used directly as a source language.

## Features

- Pure WebAssembly Text implementation
- Minimal host runtime (I/O only)
- S-expression syntax (like Lisp/Scheme)
- Portable across all WASM runtimes

## Get Started

```bash
# Compile WAT to WASM
wat2wasm src/wagasm-ssg.wat -o wagasm-ssg.wasm

# Run with Deno host
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts
```
