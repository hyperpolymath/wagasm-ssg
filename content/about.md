# About wagasm-ssg

wagasm-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in WebAssembly Text format (WAT).

## Why WebAssembly Text?

WebAssembly Text format is the human-readable representation of WebAssembly bytecode. Writing an SSG in WAT demonstrates low-level control over web technologies while maintaining portability across all WASM runtimes. This approach explores the boundaries of what is practical with stack-based, typed assembly-level code.
